# Creating an APP. 


I want to ultimately create an app which uses Zettelk√§sten method and combines it with spaced repetition learning. This can and **must** be broken into multiple layers, otherwise this beast will be too large to handle. This is all-in-all a full-year project, and I need to dedicate some time every week to make this happen. What is required foremost for achieving this structure and dedication.
